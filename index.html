            <p><strong>Howdy!</strong></p>
            <p>I am an Engineering Honors sophomore at Texas A&amp;M University majoring in Computer Science while also attaining a minor in Statistics. I developed a fond relationship with programming ever since my middle school career started with video games and network sockets. Additionally, I grew to become passionate with statistics during my senior year of high school as I was enrolled in an AP Statistics course.</p>
            <p>I mainly gained my proficient experience from back-end development as I created projects that revolved around the multiplayer games I loved, but have toyed around with front-end development (as you can see with this website!). With the start of my post-secondary education, I am trying to discover the fields of Full-Stack Development, Software Engineering, and Data Science. To see what I’ve learned over the years, check below! </p>
            <p>Additionally, I am always an avid learner! Besides playing around with code, I began developing music in FL Studio, designing and editing photos and videos with Adobe products, and playing board games, but I have and will always watch my favorite Houston sports teams try to win it all.</p>
            <p><b>Due to the current COVID-19 situation, I am now seeking summer and fall internship opportunities relating to Software Engineering and Data Science.</b> Feel free to get in touch with me!</p>

                      <li>I received an opportunity to work at Essentia Advisory Partners LLC for Summer 2019, which was a start-up consulting company established in 2016 that has seen growth in all areas since then.</li>
                      <li>Their main focus is working with commodity markets, specifically with oil, gas, and energy. I was able to work with the company’s directors and partners in handling CTRM software, developing RPA solutions, and updating SQL databases.</li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>With the company’s strong support for the Allegro CTRM software, I was able to handle a client’s data for various operations and tasks in addition to also understanding how reports can be built.</li>
                        <li>The uprise of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has allowed the company to invest and look further into such processes for potential clients. Along with another intern, we were able to jumpstart the company's first research and development of RPA solutions for menial business tasks.</li>
                        <ul>
                          <li>One process that was developed for a demonstration included the Abbyy Cloud OCR RESTful API, which was utilized to process a significant amount of contract data for a client.</li>
                          <li>Other processes were developed that included the integration of the Allegro CTRM software, Quickbooks, Outlook, and others. Processes were developed with UiPath Studio.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>The company also provides cloud hosting and development of software. Both services require the storage of data, and the utilization of AWS and SQL were prominent.</li>
                        <ul>
                          <li>With guidance, I manipulated and updated a SQL database to develop class and visual models for the Allegro CTRM software in C#.</li>

            <p>A machine learning project, in conjunction with the CSCE 421 course and Texas A&amp;M's ENDEAVR Project, that allows the city of Nolanville, TX to gather information regarding the city by utilizing SMS text messages without the need for an internet connection. It utilizes Twilio Autpilot and a Flask-based back-end to process text messages with machine learning, a MongoDB Atlas database, and the Google Cloud Platform API for directions and the AccuWeather API for forecasting and weather data. This project, among others in the organization of ENDEAVR One, allows the city to push towards a "smart city" platform, where there is constant collaboration between students majoring in Computer Science, Landscape Architecture, Urban Planning, and Visualization. </b></p>
